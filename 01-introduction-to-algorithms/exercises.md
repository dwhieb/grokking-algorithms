1. Suppose you have a list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search. What's the maximum number of steps it would take?

    The maximum number of steps it would take to find a name in a list of 128 names would be `log_2(128)` or `7` steps:

    ```
    log
    log_2(128) = x
    2^x = 128
    2^x = 2^7
    x = 7
    ```

2. Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?

    If you double the size of the list to 256 name, the maximum number of steps it would take to find a name in the list would be `log_2(256)` or `8`.

    ```
    log_2(256) = x
    2^x = 128
    2^x = 8
    ```
