1. You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All the boxes are of different sizes, and you’re trying to maximize the space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?

  > A greedy algorithm for this problem could always select the largest box first, and repeat until the space is full. This will not give you the optimal solution.

2. You’re going to Europe, and you have seven days to see everything you can. You assign a point value to each item (how much you want to see it) and estimate how long it takes. How can you maximize the point total (seeing all the things you really want to see) during your stay? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?

  > A greedy solution to this problem would entail seeing the thing with the highest point value first, and repeating this procedure until you are out of time. This would not necessarily yield the optimal solution.
